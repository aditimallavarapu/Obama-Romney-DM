clean the data	-- python
write clean data into a file	--python
fix missing values	--manual
	fix time ---- lot of missing values 
	for now deleting the data and time columns
break into n grams	now only unigram
find frequencies	python



Drawbacks:

If i remove date and time, we need to remove date and time from the test file too-- java script????
 
 
Next Steps:
write frequencies to a file????
N- fold how?
may be try it in weka after having written to the file
calculate recall precision fscore for current training
integrate the other training sheet also - Romney
